Thanks very much for your interest in this project. The directory called "screens" contains screens for
an application design. Your goal is to build a webpage that will match this design as closely as possible.
There is an empty directory called "project" that we've started, where you can build your application. 
There are image assets in the "assets" directory for you to use, and there is very basic example in the 
"example" directory that you can use as a guide for how we typically develop. If you are able to add 
smooth navigation transitions and animation, that is something that we value here. Feel free to use the 
internet to do any research you need to build the application as well as you can, but avoid using 
frameworks or libraries other than those we've already included in the directory. We don't expect this 
application to be pixel-perfect, and we'd just like to see what you're able to put together at this 
point. If you're having trouble getting started, or if you encounter any problems along the way, we 
really encourage you to send an email to acote@kaon.com so we can get on track.

Thanks again,
the Kaon team
