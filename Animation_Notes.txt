We’d like to land on the “Entry” screen when we launch the webpage. 
If we click on the Government tile, the right side of the screen should slide off to the right, 
and reveal the full background image as seen in “Gov_1”. From there, if we select “Explore”, 
we’d like the option menu in “Gov_2” to appear. None of those options are selectable in this demo. 
If we choose the arrow in the top right corner of the Gov screen, the right panel returns and we 
see the Entry screen again. Selecting the Healthcare tile brings us to the “Health” screen by 
sliding the left panel off the left side of the screen and revealing the Healthcare background. 
There are two options on the Healthcare screen, but neither are selectable in this demo. The arrow 
in the top left corner of Healthcare returns us to the Entry screen.
